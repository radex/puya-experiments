Experimenting with very, very cheap microcontrollers - PY32 series by PUYA(普冉). STM32-like, Cortex M0, but cheaper!

Includes breakout board designs (KiCad 8 projects) for:

- py32f002af15p6tu - a $0.15 TSSOP-20 microcontroller
- PY32F003L24D6TR - a comparatively pricey ($0.29) but tiny 2x3mm DFN-8 microcontroller
